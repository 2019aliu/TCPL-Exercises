# Solutions to X.3: A Tour of C++: The Basics

1. Cool :smile: (I don't have any notes from this section)
2. A compiler translate source code into machine code which is written in the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA).
3. See `helloworld.cpp`
4. Some C++ compilers:
   1. MinGW / GCC (from GNU)
   2. G++ (also from GNU, improvements on GCC to target C++. Is currently the most popular)
   3. Clang
5. See `readwrite.cpp`
6. See `readwrite.cpp`
7. An invariant is a condition that is assumed to be true. It is generally the job of the constructor to enforce these conditions, as distributing the responsibility of enforcing this implicit guarantee may cause incosistencies, such as a virtual method that has multiple implementations.
