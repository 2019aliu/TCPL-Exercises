# Solutions to X.4: A Tour of C++: Abstraction Mechanisms

1. Cool :smile:
2. Pertaining types that are built-in versus not built-in:
   1. Five examples of concrete types that are built into C++ are:
      1. `int`
      2. `float`
      3. `bool`
      4. `char`
      5. `double`
   2. Five examples of concrete types that are not built-in types in C++:
      1. `map`
      2. `list`
      3. `set`
      4. `vector`
      5. `string` (this can be debated, but I don't think it's concrete)
